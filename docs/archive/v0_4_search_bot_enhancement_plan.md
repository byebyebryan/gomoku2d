# `v0.4.0` Search Bot Enhancement Plan

Status: ad-hoc implementation plan. This captures the current bot-lab work loop
so the commit boundaries and evaluation gates stay clear.

Current progress:

- Commit 1 and Commit 2 landed together in
  `29a88ca feat(bot): scaffold tactical search experiments`.
- Commit 3 tactical candidates was rejected after focused testing.
- Commit 4 tactical move ordering was rejected after focused testing.
- Commit 5 tactical eval was rejected after focused testing.
- Commit 6 tactical shape features is in progress.

## Goal

Evolve the existing `SearchBot` into a measurable experimental bot without
forking a separate `AdvancedSearchBot` yet. The current baseline must remain
reproducible, and experimental features should only become exposed config after
they show value in focused tests.

## Design Direction

Keep one `SearchBot` implementation, but do not keep dead feature toggles in
`SearchBotConfig`. The first three shallow integration attempts were discarded,
so the next pass should improve the analyzer vocabulary before wiring new
behavior into search.

Stable lab specs stay focused on reproducible baseline configs:

- `search-d3`
- `fast`
- `balanced`
- `deep`

This avoids duplicating the search loop while still allowing tournament reports
to compare meaningful variants once a feature has earned a config surface.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Freeze Baseline Behavior

Lock down current `SearchBot` behavior before tactical changes affect move
choice.

- Keep `SearchBot::new(depth)` and `SearchBotConfig::custom_depth(depth)` as
  frozen baseline config.
- Add tests that baseline constructors preserve the current config.
- Ensure trace output records stable config fields so reports explain which
  knobs were active.
- Keep current web practice bot behavior unchanged.

### Phase 2: Add Experimental Config And Tactical Analyzer Skeleton

Add the scaffolding required for ablation tests without changing search results.

- Keep `SearchBotConfig` stable until an experiment proves useful.
- Keep lab spec parsing focused on stable baseline depth specs and named
  presets.
- Add an internal tactical analyzer skeleton.
- First analyzer fields:
  - legal move
  - immediate win
  - immediate block
- Do not wire analyzer output into candidate generation, ordering, or eval yet.

### Phase 3: Tactical Candidates

Decision: discarded for now.

Focused testing showed that immediate-win/block candidate expansion is
redundant with the current radius-2 baseline. A 16-game Renju comparison at
1000 ms CPU/move ended `search-d3` over `search-d3+candidates` by `9-7`, with
the candidates variant slightly higher average move time and budget exhaustion.

Learning:

- Do not keep a `tactical_candidates` toggle just to force-add immediate
  wins/blocks.
- Candidate expansion may become useful later, but only after the analyzer can
  identify richer shapes that radius-2 can miss in practice.
- Move ordering and eval can proceed without widening the candidate set.

### Phase 4: Tactical Move Ordering

Decision: discarded for now.

Immediate-win/block ordering was not strong enough to keep as a separate
toggle. A corrected implementation used tactical priority before TT tie-breaks,
but an 8-game Renju comparison at 1000 ms CPU/move ended `search-d3` over
`search-d3+ordering` by `5-3`. The ordering variant searched fewer nodes but
had higher average move time and slightly higher budget exhaustion.

Learning:

- Do not keep an immediate-win/block-only `tactical_move_ordering` toggle.
- The existing TT ordering is already useful; shallow tactical sorting can
  interfere without producing better play.
- Revisit ordering only after tactical eval/shape detection can classify richer
  threats.

### Phase 5: Tactical Eval

Decision: discarded for now.

The first pass only scored immediate winning moves for the current player and
the opponent. That is too shallow: the baseline search/root prefilter already
handles many immediate tactical cases, while adding another leaf-eval branch
increased complexity without producing a clear strength gain.

Learning:

- Do not keep an immediate-win/block-only `tactical_eval` toggle.
- Eval work should wait until the analyzer can describe richer shapes:
  open three, open four, blocked four, broken three, double threat, and forcing
  reply.
- The next commit should be behavior-neutral shape detection with focused unit
  tests, not another direct search integration.

### Phase 6: Tactical Shape Features

Add richer analyzer output without changing move choice.

Initial target features:

- open four
- blocked four
- open three
- broken three
- double threat

This should stay behind internal helpers and tests. Search integration comes
later only if the shape features are correct and readable.

Current implementation note: this slice adds labels to `analyze_tactical_move`
only. The search loop still uses the same candidates, ordering, and static eval
as the baseline.

## Intended Commit Boundaries

### Commit 1: Config Plumbing And Baseline Guardrails

Includes:

- Baseline constructor/preset guardrails.
- Trace output for stable config fields.
- Lab spec parser tests for stable depth specs and named presets.
- Rejection tests for discarded feature suffixes.
- Tests for baseline defaults and parser behavior.

Expected behavior change: none.

### Commit 2: Tactical Analyzer Skeleton

Includes:

- Internal tactical analyzer type/helper.
- Tests for immediate win and immediate block detection.
- No integration with candidate generation, ordering, or eval.

Expected behavior change: none.

Completed in `29a88ca` together with Commit 1.

### Commit 3: Tactical Candidates

Decision: discarded.

Record the failed experiment in this doc and remove the config/code path rather
than carrying a toggle with no demonstrated value.

### Commit 4: Tactical Move Ordering

Decision: discarded.

Record the failed experiment in this doc and remove the config/code path rather
than carrying another shallow tactical toggle.

### Commit 5: Tactical Eval

Decision: discarded.

Record the failed experiment in this doc and remove the config/code path rather
than carrying a third shallow tactical toggle.

### Commit 6: Tactical Shape Features

Includes:

- Analyzer fields for richer tactical shapes.
- Curated board tests for open/blocked fours, open threes, broken threes, and
  double threats.
- No candidate generation, ordering, or eval integration.

Expected behavior change: none.

## Evaluation Gates

Before moving from one behavioral commit to the next:

- `cargo fmt --all --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --workspace`
- `wasm-pack build gomoku-bot-lab/gomoku-wasm --target bundler`
- `npm --prefix gomoku-web run build`

For behavioral integration commits, also run at least a small ablation
tournament. After a feature survives focused testing, run a clean full
tournament report and publish/update the report only from a clean code commit.

## Risks

- Tactical candidates can increase branching factor enough to erase strength
  gains.
- Tactical ordering can improve pruning but also bias the bot into shallow
  tactical tunnel vision.
- Tactical eval is the highest-risk phase because tuning can pass unit tests
  while making play feel worse.
- Shape detection can easily become a second rules engine. Keep the analyzer
  narrow, tested, and derived from existing core board APIs where possible.
- If toggles make `search.rs` too hard to reason about, revisit splitting into
  a separate bot or extracting modules before adding more features.
